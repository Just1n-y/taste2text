First time was great the chef was personable and fun, the second time not so much, he was Hispanic (not that it mattered but so you know if you get him) and he didn't do any tricks besides the volcano, he also wasted more rice and veggies than he handed out, he didn't seem like he wanted to be there or cooking for that matter so he rushed the entire experience and the food was ok, steak over cooked and again everyone got different portions of rice and veggies because he wasted most of it. I wish we had the same guy we had the first time he was fun and gave us all proper portions. We will be back again but will ask for the chef we had a good time with.\n\nSushi is good but a bit over priced, maybe because we no longer live on the coast I notice the difference in price but it is what more here than it is in California.\n\nSalad with ginger dressing is amazing!! The clear soup tastes like dish soup..go for the miso!!\n\nThe pics im posting are from the first time that we really enjoyed the food\n\nAlso they give military discount so don't forget to show them your id!!"}]}]}

I have had some great experiences and some horrible ones at our Casper location. But I am changing them from a 1 to a 5 star since they have earned it back with our last 4 experiences with them.  The dine in restaurant has raised to a level in the past few months we haven't seen here in 5 years. The service is exceptional and the food is back to what we have grown to expect from them in the last 30 years. With that said, their take away is absolutely phenomenal... The food has always been as good at home as it is off the line.  Hot, but not burnt from the lights or heated in some other artificial way.  The salad is crisp and fresh and the bread sticks almost as good as right out of the oven. In the last month we have done take away twice and dined in once and all three have been better then the one before.  My hat is off to either the new manager or the change the old one has made whichever is the case.  The last visit was my birthday lunch and I enjoyed every minute of it from our server to the food to the wonderful desert they gave me to the great plate of chocolate with \"Happy Birthday\" on it.  I highly recommend this Olive Garden, not only over their other locations but over 95% of all restaurants in town."}]}]}

The placed was packed and I am always hesitant at trying a new steak place. We ordered the cowboy steak for 2 and the 3/$15 sides (truffle mac and cheese, truffle asparagus, and brussel sprouts). I thought for the amount of food you get for your sides was a good deal. There was not much truffle taste in the asparagus, but you could definitely taste a hint of it. Those were my least favorite side dish, but it was still good. The truffle mac and cheese was my favorite side. Great truffle flavor and crispy on the top and bottom. No complaints there! We ordered medium rare for our steak and it was cooked perfectly. Flavor was on point! I was not expecting that at all. The server was nice and the food took a little time, but it was busy, so it was expected. Atmosphere was dark and dimly lit, but fit the ambiance. It was loud it there, but that did not bother either of us. Overall, it was a good experience and prices were fair for what you got! I would definitely give it a try if you are willing to wait."}]}]}

My big salad was the same size as my partner\u2019s side salad, just in a plastic box instead of cardboard. I think it was around 13 bucks for a little bit of romaine, shaved parm, and some croutons. Literally could have had a better bagged salad from the grocery store for a fraction of the price. My spouse ordered the 9 dollar grown up grilled cheese and it looked like a kid\u2019s sandwich. It was just a dry sandwich, it didn\u2019t have any of the extras described on the menu. I\u2019m not sure why our orders came out so messed up, but this place is pretty pricy for subpar meals. If the food actually was what was described in the menu it might be worth it. My neighbor has the same experience, three times in a row, so we will not be going back."}]}]}

They messed up our order and charged/brought me for three more slices than we ordered but I was tired after being in the car  all day so I ate one and took the others to go since the kids will eat it at some point.  There's no table service; if you want another beer you go back to the counter."}]}]}

The bathroom smelled like a pool (in a good, properly sanitized kinda way) and tables were cleaned within two minutes of other guests' departure. My server was incredibly attentive to my needs and checked in frequently. If only there was a location in Rapid City, I would be there weekly. With a two hour drive, I would still consider making a trip every couple of months just to eat here. Do us all a favor and support this establishment.

About 3-4 months ago I cracked my bumper and had it replaced with a brand new bumper/paint.\n\nMove to Cheyenne a week ago, first time bringing my car in for a simple oil change.  I\u2019m asked if I\u2019d like a complimentary car wash, which I regrettably accepted.\n\nI receive my car and notice there\u2019s a large chip in the paint of my bumper.  Keep in mind the vehicle has 15K miles and the bumper probably less than 3K.\n\nI call the dealership and am transferred to the \u201cmanager\u201d Mike.  He doesn\u2019t answer, so I leave a voicemail politely explaining the situation and requesting a call back.\n\nI wait two hours and still, no response.  At this point, I drive back to the dealership to wait an additional 15 minutes so they can track him down because no one seems to know where he is.\n\nImmediately he begins to defend the fact that it\u2019s not possible his car washers, using bristle brushes, could\u2019ve knicked or caused any damage.  THEN, he pulls out a report that allegedly was filled out when my car was worked on, which was not at all the report that was given to me when I first left.\n\nTheir inspection for my car came back perfect, absolutely nothing wrong.  Then, when I\u2019m asking about the chip in the paint, he finds a \u201cpaper that was on his desk\u201d describing previous marks on a brand new bumper and further attempts to tell me I need to go BACK to the Subaru in CASPER to \u201clook into clear coat warranty\u201d\n\nI\u2019m absolutely appalled that a manager would choose to lose a customer who has spent thousands of dollars across several dealerships, driving a brand new Subaru STI with warranty (basically their \u2018prime\u2019 customer type) over a paint chip.\n\nI couldn\u2019t say nicer things about the girls at the reception desk!  Unfortunately they aren\u2019t the ones who can make things right though.  Hopefully this review deters even one Subaru enthusiast from losing their love for the brand due to a poor manager.\n\nAs you can see from the photos, that\u2019s not at all \u201croad debris\u201d especially 30 minutes after receiving from them.   Absolutely falls on the management that fails to take accountability.  Instead I will take these photos to Small Claims Court, or wherever necessary to make this right.  To try to blame this on another Subaru dealership is pathetic."}]}]}

My guest had the \"Hub Burger\".\n\nThey cooked both of our burgers on the same grill but have a section of it reserved for non-meat cooking.\n\nPresently they are open for breakfast and lunch.  They have a wide assortment of fresh made pastries prepared in their own kitchen.  They are a welcome addition to downtown daytime dining in Cheyenne."}]}]}

The Pho beef was 9.99 and it was a large bowl, but we thought there would have been more meat for that price.\n\nOverall, I give it 4 stars. Bigger portions or lower prices would give it 5 stars."}]}]}

I was fortunate enough to sit at an empty bar with their great bartender making me his signature specialities. I only wish I was here during happy hour. #TacoQuest50"}]}]}

The owner, however, was up in her cabin and saw us come and graciously directed us to our cabin. Extremely cute cabin. We had chose the one with a double bed and two single beds - sitting bull. That's two separate rooms which connect through the bathroom. It's all wooden so things creak. But totally loved it!! We stayed for 2 nights and requested a campfire the second night and they started one for us. We bought the s'mores. It is very homely, which I loved. A lot of the people staying there seem to come here very often. I could not distinguish between customers and family!\n\nThey offer breakfast for 10.95 per person. It's is very filling. Loved the hash browns and the eggs. We didn't take the horse rides and fishing trips they offer, but may be worth a shot. Good place to stay at if you are coming from Cody.\n\nNot much to do in east Yellowstone so if you want to go to the main park, this is not the best accommodation option."}]}]}

Grilled oysters with so much cheese that you couldn't taste any oysters.  Gumbo roux wasn't dark at all making a fairly bland gumbo except for the cayenne.  Ribeye cooked nicely at rare, even under slightly, but it was covered on oil/butter, even pooling up on the plate.  Ribeye is the fattiest piece of meat you can order other than prime rib possibly.  The last thing anyone should do is add more fat on top of it.  Just made for an oily, greasy piece of beef that was hard to eat much of.  A few tweaks and this place would be ok."}]}]}

Service was also very good, we were not rushed at all.  Very enjoyable meal and experience."}]}]}

The good news is SRB stays open til 11p, and serve until at least 9:30p.\n\nWe split a whole Caesar, a cup of chowder, the bolognese, and the burger.\n\nThey were all wonderful. I loved the Ragu in the pasta, and the noodles were perfect. The dish had a nice light flavor - not huge tomato sauce flavor, or just buttered noodles. The burger was super flavorful, with some awesome bacon. The chowder was really thick and sweet, and the salad crisp and zesty.\n\nCan\u2019t speak to the beers but they have fun names.\n\nBest of all, the bar is huge, comfy, well lit, not too loud, with the nicest staff we could hope for. Super attentive and helpful and friendly.\n\nThanks for saving our dinner and our night."}]}]}

The inside of the establishment has a nice rustic atmosphere that fits a place like Pinedale, but my critique is that parts of the restaurant felt unkempt and dishoveled - especially the entrance. Taking a little time to clean and tidy up the entrance would go a long way. The customer service was lacking and we felt as if we were imposing on the staff by coming into the restaurant. A few more smiles and a little bit of friendly talk would have been welcome. Really the pizza tasted pretty good, but these other issues took away from the overall experience."}]}]}

When we pulled up, there\u2019s a large, outdoor space with a bunch of seating, green space, etc. - it looks super fun actually! It was raining and cold the day we were there so we sat inside which was fine by us. Cozied up at a table right next to the fireplace and that\u2019s where their 3 stars are coming from. Fire was great, however, there were a bunch of flies near our table and upon further inspection, all around the fireplace, windows, etc. was dirty; spiderwebs, dust & dirt. I know this is a brewery therefore you\u2019ll have the smell of beer throughout, but the smell was like stale beer that had been sitting for a while - just not appealing.\n\nThe food:\nApparently they\u2019re known for their chili and it\u2019s won awards - it\u2019s a beef/bison chili - it was good, but not great. The chili on its own that is - with all of the toppings, this helped elevate the flavors a bit. Overall, I\u2019d rate the chili a 7.\n\nThe beer:\nI opted for their sour - again, good but not anything to write home about. Would give that a 6.5.\n\nThe service:\nWas average - I\u2019d give it a 7.\n\nThe COVID:\nStaff wears masks and gloves - hand sanitizer can be found throughout, so they\u2019re doing what they should be doing in that respect. An 8.\n\nThe overall:\nA good place to grab a couple of beers and hang with friends - they also have plenty of TV\u2019s if you want to catch a game. The cleanliness is really what made this review a 3 - if it weren\u2019t for that, would have probably rated it a 4, but nothing was outstanding and nothing was horrible."}]}]}

Then when we were ordering he kept giving us attitude like we were imposing on him with our 3 kiddos. After finishing eating we sat there for about 45 minutes just waiting to see him again to get the check, as soon as we stand up to go ask for it he suddenly appears with it asking all the how was the food, need anything else ect questions. Like yeah maybe an hour ago when my cup first got empty. I wish I could've tipped the cooks because they deserved it this was the first time we ordered something and enjoyed it I just wish our experience would've matched.

Even though the order was through the app and all laid out, it was still delivered wrong. We somehow ended up with chicken, when no one ordered chicken. The bottom buns on all the burgers were soggy. There were fries on orders that didn't order fries. An extra salad tjrown in. Burgers were very plain for the price. The bacon wrapped shrimp was $14 and came with 4 shrimp.... Crazy price for what it was. Just overall a disappointment for the $100 and mandatory tip for the Door Dash driver."}]}]}

We were there with another family of 4 and the waitress handled our total party of 4 kids 4 adults just fine. Sandwiches were okay but the shrimp and fries were surprisingly good in landlocked Wyoming-generous serving and fried just right. This place also has a huge pie selection but the waitress did not even ask if we wanted dessert.\n\nWe ended up buying a peach pie on the return trip home and ate it elsewhere! It was tasty.\n\nOverall, not bad, not great, but a good pit stop on the way to Mt. Rushmore."}]}]}

It also came with simple, but good mashed potatoes and steamed veggies that stole the show. I could have eaten a whole plate of them! The chefs salad was good. It had quite a bit of meat. I liked that it had roast beef in it. Last, but not least was the pie. They probably had 8-10 pies to choose from. The peach in the peach raspberry pie toned down the intense flavor of the raspberries a little bit. All in all it was a very good meal. After dinner I walked up and down the street. It is the origional downtown which Is very quaint. It was like walking through a gallery as there were amazing bronze statues every few feet lining both sides of the street. Lovely. l am definitely looking foward going back the the Cowboy Cafe and strolling along the streets of Sheridan, WY."}]}]}

The menu is quite large, and give them points for creativity and the theme, but the menu is so large and is overwhelming with all of the change of font and color. Comes off as unorganized. I appreciate the effort though, and with this type of environment you can come with friends, have some beers, and watch the game, but so much distraction from the food. Like Buffalo Wild Wings, seems like the people try to distract you from the meal because it is amateur. Food is not worth the price, and there are better place, but a good place to just stop by."}]}]}

Now I\u2019m not a huge fan of the 20% mandatory tip (I believe in tipping per service and $1 per drink, but the 20% was on the pre-tax amount and the server reminded us about it when the bill came).  Service may seem a bit slow but treat it like you\u2019re overseas, raise your hand when needed and all is good.  I did the simple checkbox gesture and the bill promptly came.  If you are passive, it might be a bit of torture.  I would come back and I do recommend!!  Nice work!!"}]}]}

We were first told, \"we'll give them call\". 30 mins and nothing changed, we called again and were told \"we'll call them again\". One hour later and again no changed, we called a third time. This time we were told \"they never answered, and even if they did, we can't make someone turn of their porch light. Just throw some of your pillows up to block the windows\". Im sorry what? So this entire time you made it sound like something was being done, but actually you never talked to anyone? You can't send someone to knock? Instead throw some pillows up to the windows 12 feet up?  Why would you give the only control to an outside light to the user inside, and not give the cabin across the way curtains? All this for $400+ a night because of flaw in your cabin architecture? Give me a break.\n\nWe decided we wanted to cut our stay short and end our vacation early because our room was so lite up that neither myself, my wife or my 3 year old couldn't sleep. They told us sorry but there are no refunds.\n\nThought I was treating my family to a nice higher end location. Instead i got one of the worse, overpriced stays of my life. The cabin setup, those answers, and lack of front desk...I'll never stay here again. Save the money on this over priced place and stay somewhere else in town.\n\nOnly redeeming factor was the cleaning staff, they were great and always helpful. That was part of the reason I also hated the front desks idea of throwing pillows up top. The cleaning staff will have to work harder to retrieve them. It showed a lack of respect for the cleaning staff and laziness of the front desk. Instead just send someone to knock. Come on."}]}]}

Not only have the former employees gone unpaid for their labor (including Valentines day, which is one of the busiest days in the business year for Cody), there are major health concerns within the kitchen in this establishment.\nI've worked within kitchens in Downtown Seattle, Denver, South Carolina, New Orleans, and multiple restaurants in Cody and I've never encountered such a concerning kitchen. Upon hiring I came into a completely unsanitized environment. The fryer hadn't been cleaned in months. From the looks of it it could have been years since the actual equipment had been cleaned, I've attached a photo. I have never seen kitchen equipment covered in this much grease. It took an entire shift of two employees scraping the caked on grit. The establishment doesn't own a oil basin so there is no way to dispose of the used fryer oil and as a result it is very rarely cleaned. Usually it's required to at least drain and sift the oil nightly, and clean the fryer itself weekly, and during my five months of employment it was cleaned once. My concerns were brought to the owner with little attention on his part.\nThe knives which are used to cut raw meat along with raw vegetables on the same board were never sanitized between uses and sat overnight filthy and reused again the next day. Along with the water pot used to reboil the precooked pasta, the water would sit in the pot for days reused and rarely drained. The baskets which hold the pasta were never cleaned.\nThe walk-in refrigerator is outdated and contains a dark mold that covers the wooden shelves which could very well be black mold. It is nearly never cleaned or shown any attention. Rotting food sits in the corners. In one case of being cleaned, when we tried to lift the pallets off the floor to mop, there was so much gunk underneath that it actually ripped the floor tile off completely because it was stuck to the pallet.\nAs to the quality of the ingredients, it's laughable that this restaurant can claim fine dining. The sauce comes out of a can, and the meat is the lowest quality the owner can find, along with all the other ingredients. The establishment claims it has the best steaks in town, yet they don't own a grill. To try to compete with the many steak houses on main street it is asinine to claim themselves as a steakhouse. Most of the steaks will sit thawed for weeks during the winter before being served.\nThe owner was absent for almost the entirety of my employment. He would not communicate with his employees and shown no concern to the state of his establishment. In fact when he came back, I watched him prepare a meal grabbing a raw chicken breast with his bare hands and continue to prep and serve. On Valentine's day, he had a seven year old child preparing raw salads for the public, with no gloves (since they obviously don't make a size small enough for children).\nIt's concerning that nearly all of the five star reviews are from either his employees, or his business friends. This restaurant may fool the tourists, but when it comes to the community of Cody, it is easily defined as one of the worst establishments in town."}]}]}

You know a place is good when it's on the very edge, heading out of a small town and it has a wait...! We had a very large group (14) and they worked us into tables quickly and treated us as a group though spread out to 3 tables. Everyone was friendly! Heads up that they do NOT take credit cards. No problem, we had cash. Our server, Anna, was attentive and smiley.\nThe menu offers breakfast on one side and a variety of favorites on the other. My table of 4 (of our 14) had a kid's breakfast (french toast she said was \"YUM!\"), a kid's corndog (she says, \"YUM!\"), a cheeseburger (she says, \"it was delicious!\"), and I got the Grizzly (enchilada). Very tasty. Other 2 tables of our group say it was definitely a return to place!!!\nSmall restaurant. Handful of tables... I'd guess 50 or less seating. They close at 2pm, but I heard they stop seating a little before that. Highly recommend. Will go back probably each time we come to Cody"}]}]}

Paid $30 for the 2 tacos which I didn't eat. and the app which was great. Loved the whiskey sauce on the chicken. The app was $10. Which means I threw away $20 of the $30 I spent. Smh.

We ordered this because we know Lake Trout is an invasive species, and we like to support vendors that try to eradicate invasive species.\nHere is the problem, the menu states the lake trout is \"farm raised\". I could not help but laugh because any angler knows that Lake Trout aka Mackinaw are deep water fish that are impossible to \"farm\". I found out that they source the fish from \"Native Fish Keepers\"\nfrom the Flathead Lake in NW Montana.\nI pulled up the website and asked to speak to the chef. I showed him that the website clearly says \"wild-caught\", and asked why the menu says \"farm raised\". His response was, \"wow, I didn't know it was wild caught, and I also didn't know the menu said farm raised\". I explained why this minor detail mattered, but he didn't seem to care very much. I emailed Chef Mike Dean that evening to address this error. Chef Dean was clearly too busy to respond.\nWhile this may seem like a minor detail, it is not. It exemplifies the credibility of a location, the staff, and moreover, the corporation. I stopped in two weeks after I brought this to the attention of Chef Alex, and Chef Dean, and the menu STILL says farm raised, despite them admitting the error.\nAfter our \"farm raised lake trout\" plate \ud83e\udd23 we had a Bison Tenderloin, ordered medium rare, presented to us at medium well. I'm curious now if that was Bison or if it was in fact a cattle yard cow?"}]}]}

The food was good and definitely worth the often 30+ minute wait. What brings this restaurant down is the inhospitable host staff, and lack of sanitary care during this COVID-19 time of heightened cleanliness.\n\nThe hostess went to seat us and had to have us wait as she bussed the area around where we were to be seated. After sitting down a little while later a busser comes by and comments about the large number of tortilla chips all over the floor where we are sitting and how we have not even been served food yet. He seemed quite embarrassed.\n\nAs we were eating we kept seeing what appeared to be personal items and dishes commingled behind a ledge where the stuffed animals are displayed. Upon closer look there was all sorts of debris and other junk up there, it certainly did not look like a safe and sanitary way to store plates and silverware.\n\nThe drinks were left mostly empty and the service remained lackluster. All in all, really a bit disappointed in this storied establishment."}]}]}

Contacted management & informed them of problem and stated that we would like to file a warranty claim. Asked if they would send someone to look at defects (January) and they said due to Covid pandemic please send photos.  I sent photos & copy of invoice.  They said it was easier to replace the arms rather than repair them.  After a month, I contacted them & was told the parts hadn\u2019t come yet & could take longer due to Covid delays.  Called in April & was told the parts came in but now they are waiting on upholstery guy to get back to them to schedule repairs.  Really disappointed in being slow played!!!  I\u2019m beginning to think they are not going to warranty their products.  I\u2019m less than impressed with their warranty service.\n\n05/10/21 -update\nFinally getting some movement on getting this resolved.  Updating stars to three stars since they have sent repair person.  Recliner has been returned & they are working on sofa.

The rest of the experience was NOT.\n\nI consider myself a foody and was really excited to come to this restaurant. They were closed Sunday/Monday so we had it on our list to come on Tuesday..\nBoy where we disappointed.\n\nWe got to the restaurant at 530 (when they opened) and we were sat immediately. We  didn\u2019t get our first order (noodles) until 630 PM.\n\nWe spoke to another server who was a nice blonde lady and she apologized and comped us a free round of drinks. We appreciated this as we were hungry and still waiting for our food at this point....\n\nOur server FINALLY drops our noodles an hour and 20 minutes later and said it would be another 25 minutes for the curry we ordered.... to be clear this is a two person table!!! We ordered noodles, curry, nan and broccoli.\n\nWe asked to take our food to go because we had been sitting there for an hour and a half. When we FINALLY get the rest of our to go order at 645... our server didn\u2019t even order the broccoli!\n\nWe waited an hour and 45 minutes - got to eat one dish in the restaurant ( to their credit it was really good) requested the rest to go because of how long it took & then didn\u2019t even get our full order Togo.\n\nOur server said that they were busy with to go orders..... I have worked in a restaurant as a server for over 7 years and this was the worst experience I have had. If the kitchen is prioritizing to go orders rather than taking care of their customers in the restaurant that is a problem. If our server was not communicating with the kitchen/management team - then he was just not doing his job and the management team needs to better train their staff.\n\nI only give reviews when I have a wonderful experience or a terrible experience. The ONE dish we had was good, but I wouldn\u2019t waste my time coming back here due to the service.\n\nI hope management reads this review and looks at the way your managing your business. Cut to go orders if your kitchen is swamped and prioritize your current customers."}]}]}

They know just how long to linger for a chat, when to refill drinks, and when to bring the next course.\n\nThe food is excellently prepared with a focus on flavor. The combinations of herbs and spices and the parings of proteins, grains, and vegetables are indicative of an experienced, knowledgeable chef. The desserts are also expertly considered.

Then let's order breakfast....oh we stopped serving breakfast about 40 minutes ago. Then we need a few more minutes to decide.  Comes back one orders a sandwich, I order just a simple side salad with a side of French. Waitress comes with food sits it down, well guess it's Italian or none so I start eating my lettuce, slice of tomato and cucumber slice. Oh my goodness they gave me lettuce that was old and wilted and tasted awful. I give up. I told the waitress it's been non-stop wrong since I stepped in.

But these 2 appetizers could have been meals by themselves we ordered without asking a full loaf of onion strings and a half order of nachos what a surprise when they were brought out the onion strings on a platter and the nachos in an iron skillet and they both looked incredible. There was only 2 of us but these appetizers could have easily fed 4 people. My nephew and I tried our best but didn't come close to finishing. Both of these appetizers were wonderful the onion strings were perfectly deep fried with a light and very tasty coating that we couldn't quite figure out and they came with an excellent dipping sauce. The nachos were tremendous they were served in the skillet there made in and they are loaded with your choice of chicken or beef we chose beef and than they pile on the cheese and onions and beans and sour cream,tomatoes and we think a bit of avocado and tortilla chips all layered and incredibly delicious. The service was great and inside of this bar/restaurant is such a good time to see this is a must do if your in Sheridan."}]}]}

She never hesitated to fill drinks or ask how things were going. She chatted with us in her down time and was very friendly. I ordered the Noodles. There flavor was a bit overwhelming. The sauce seems like someone had dumped a ton of soy sauce all over the plate. My husband ordered the bacon burger with regular fries. The ranch he requested was some of the BEST we've ever had! He loved the flavor of the seasoned fries and the burger was cooked perfect. We ordered the spicy tomato bisque and grilled cheese that didn't make it out until after our entrees were at the table.tl That didn't bug us one bit, the flavor of the bisque was more than we ever expected. I've had authentic french tomato bisque and this made the traditional bisque seem bland in comparison. The grill cheese was perfectly grilled and cheese was melted immaculately.  We ordered the s'mores desert that was very good. The chocolate ice cream was very rich and full of flavor. The marshmallow however seemed as though it came from a jar. It tasted of stale confectionery sugar. I should have gone for the peach cobbler. When it came time to pay we found it difficult as we never keep cash or cards on us. I tried to pay using Google pay, but they didn't accept any kind of digital payment. We figured it out, but it was inconvenient. We were given a 10% off coupon to Provisions next door. Unfortunately we are in recovery, we can gift it though. Taylor was great! Give her a raise \ud83d\ude04\n\nOver all we had a great experience and would highly recommend this dining experience to all of your friends!"}]}]}

Now, I lived in San Diego for decades and currently live in Tucson AZ -- so we know great Mexican food both Baja and Sonoran influenced.  This place was pretty decent.  We ordered chips (and guacamole on a recommendation from the gal in the restaurant) and the guacamole was delicious.  The chips did not appear to be house made -- which was a bummer.  My husband had the carne asada and he liked it, came with beans and rice, as well as a stack of corn tortillas (store bought, lost a star).  I had the chimichanga which had diced up carne asada (or some type of beef) as they did not do ground or shredded.  It was interesting, as it did not appear to be in a flour tortilla, more of a puffed type dough.  I thought it was good -- no more no less."}]}]}

The outside side walk area around the restaurant was very crowded too when we were waiting for our food to be ready.\n\nWe got the Twisted Cowgirl Dip, the Cheese Chile Relleno plate with green chile sauce, and the Wendell Special Quesadilla with shredded beef.

It wasn't bad, I just couldn't get excited about it.\n\nPrices definitely felt inflated to me. Most plates were $16-$20.

The service was slow and the food was good, but not spectacular.  Not going to go out of my way on the return trip to eat here again.\n\nA year ago...\nReally enjoyed all the fresh ingredients.  We split a large ceasar salad and a pizza and a cannoli for dessert.  We went at 7:30om on a Saturday night, and it was not crowded at all.\n\nThe pizza was hands down the best thing we ate, but that doesn't mean everything else was bad by any means.  The pizza crust was chewy and thin, but not too thin that your toppings fell through it.  The cheese was stringy, and the sause while a little sweeter than I normally like it was so thinly applied it was excellent!  You had just a hint of all the flavors together. No one topping over powered the others.\n\nI will go back and try some more foods.\n\nAlso, service was really good and our waitress was always around and checking in on us."}]}]}

Customer service is also great! Mariana was my server majority of the time and she was so sweet, every time! Also the manager (I think her name is Jessica) was very friendly as well! You MUST try this place if you're in town."}]}]}

Don\u2019t let the sleepy facade of this small town fool you, there\u2019s gold in these hills and it\u2019s this restaurant! I had a cowboy burger and it was the biggest, and one of the best burgers I\u2019ve ever had. Everything from the high quality bun and ingredients to its high class presentation make this burger worth twice as much as it\u2019s $9 price tag. There were several other burgers on the menu that looked very interesting, but with food this good I would love to try the nachos and buffalo wings as well. The chef even came out to check on us  (but I\u2019m guessing he KNOWS it\u2019s good and just comes out for the compliments). Please check this place out if you\u2019re passing through, you won\u2019t regret it."}]}]}

The on-site restaurant food was decent with excellent service-- several neighboring tables got their food for free after slow kitchen service (without complaining). There's not much to do here, but it is a short drive to see the Smith Mansion, and it's a great stop on the way to Yellowstone coming from the East entrance.

The property probably hasn't had any sort of renovation since the 90's and it is long overdue. I was offered a package when I checked in which included a discount if I spent $30 in the gift shop/restaurant/gas station. I was told to bring back my receipts and they would apply the discount. The next morning I went into the front desk with my receipts only to be told I needed to turn them in the night before. I told the front desk attendant that I was not informed that it had to be turned in the same day I checked in, only to bring my receipts back and the front desk lady would take off the discount.  The front desk attendant rudely said,  \"yeah her and she's not here\". I then asked for a manager who quickly resolved the problem. If you're going to have a strict policy on how long customers have to turn in receipts for credits on a package I didn't even ask for then you need to inform the customers of that policy. Additionally, having a bad attitude with a customer who was obviously not informed correctly by your staff will not earn you business. I will NEVER stay here again!

They also have the usual meal combos which include soup, appetizer and fried rice. But my husband and I went back twice in one week for their \"Special Chinese\" menu items. We went back again a couple of weeks later and ate inside this time, tried the Peking duck and typhoon short ribs which were also delicious! The typhoon short ribs are definitely best eaten in the restaurant when freshly cooked. Friendly staff, we'll definitely be back for more!"}]}]}

We told Paige and she immediately said well I need to get you guys some shots on the house and brought back three healthy shots which made the Margaritas okay but nothing spectacular for $9 in Laramie. Bloody Mary was spectacular!\nAnd Paige our server really saved this meal. One person got half rack of ribs, another got the full and they both looked pretty much the same size...not good. And both said they were a little dry. Steak sandwiches we're good as were the salads. Baked potatoes and Fries spectacular!\nThere was a huge table next door to us with multiple babies but we could still talk although it's a noisy place. We didn't check out the bar and we didn't get dessert maybe next time.\nThese guys are new just getting their feet under them and thanks to Page and that Bloody Mary we will try again in a couple months!"}]}]}

Cheese: Ghost Pepper Jack. Toppings: lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle. As a side I ordered mashed potatoes with brown gravy.\n\nThe burger was absolutely delicious. The meat was cooked to perfection. WARNING! The Ghost Pepper Jack cheese has a kick. Delicious and spicy. The pickles used are noticeably delicious with a satisfying crunch. The one ingredient that can use improvement is the bun. It was a little dry, bland, and thicker than I would like. Overall amazing burger.\n\nThe mashed potatoes and brown gravy was really amazing. The country style mashed potatoes with the potato skins left on are one of my favorite styles of mashed potatoes. The gravy was as expected. Brings me back to my grandfather's homemade brown gravy.\n\nPortion sizes were great and filling.\n\nPrices are appropriate. I was actually impressed at the quality of food compared to the price. You definitely get your money's worth.\n\nMy waitress Dannika did an amazing job. She was friendly and welcoming. She was always quick to refill my soda when it was close to empty. She has a great positive attitude.\n\nThank you Hitching Post Restaurant and Saloon for an amazing meal and even better service."}]}]}

The style of food is meant for sharing which explains the price and the portions! I am not into shrimp all that much, the shrimp skewer appetizer is THE BEST shrimp I've had in my life!! And the spicy pork is TO DIE FOR!!! I definitely recommend whatever food you get you try a piece of it with each of the sides you're given because they all add a different flavor!

The upbeat music provided a wonderful tempo for the night.\nWe were delighted by the appetizers, each from a different culture but very well done. The Korean BBQ ribs were especially succulent; the accompanying kimchee perfectly sour and spicy.\nEach of the entrees rocked. The butter curry was everyone's favorite, followed by the tiki masala and the pineapple fried rice. The general tso's chicken was too spicy for some in our crew, but I'm pretty sure they ate one of the peppers...I loved it. My one complaint was that the Bangkok street noodles, while they tasted authentic, smelled faintly of dog food, although I think I'm the only one in my party who smelled it.\nOtherwise, it was a perfect place to end the evening.

Get the 10oz Bavette from Snake River Farms. Best steak ever consumed in my life. Also, received some profound steak-knowledge from the awesome bartender (ski-bro from Brooklyn - you are the man!). Cuts of steak with more marbling/fat, go with a medium, or slightly under that, to render the fat into the meat. (think of a middle ground between medium and medium-rare). Game-changer and it makes perfect sense. So many places and people just go with an attitude similar to  \"ANYTHING MORE THAN MEDIUM RARE AND I'LL PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE AND ASK YOU TO LEAVE\". I think we can leave that to the \"well-done with a side of ketchup\"-crew. When you learn a bit more about cows and the difference between cuts of meat you'll find yourself on a tastier, more knowledgeable bovine adventure.\n\nThe steak was so good that I came back the next night for the same meal and great service.

The food is not experimental, but simply classic flavors done right.  For appetizers we had the blue cheese waffle fries and BLT soup.  The soup had a fresh tomato flavor and was good, but those fries wow!  The fries were crispy outside but soft on the inside and the cheese sauce needs a soppin\u2019 biscuit.  Creamy and not overpowering on the blue cheese, just the right mix.  Cocktails were the Martinez and the 1999, both were tasty.\n\nOur main courses included the pork chop and the risotto with shrimp.  The risotto was good, but not great due to it being a little pasty rather than creamy. It came with an add-on option of shrimp or steak.  I definitely would go with the shrimp as it had a noticeable lemon flavor which pairs better with the shrimp.  This is my only negative of the meal.  I know you always run the risk ordering the pork chop but I am glad I stepped out on that ledge.  It was tomahawk style bone in and cooked to medium leaving it juicy.  Paired with the creamed corn gave it the right amount of sweetness that goes well with pork.  I recommend pairing it with their brown ale Mighty Bison, it added the right amount of nuttiness.\n\nWe finished off with the s\u2019mores baked dessert in a cast iron pan. It was kind of like a graham cracker and fudge brownie cake topped with toasted marshmallow.  Delicious!  We decided to pair it with a glass of milk to satisfy the child inside.  Our waiter was excellent, sorry I do not remember his name.  4.5 out of 5 with the risotto preventing the perfect score."}]}]}

We have been anticipating to go there since we like there sister restaraunts in Lander, Cowfish and Gannett Grill. The place was hopping because of the Fremont County Fair. You go up to the kitchen counter and order and they give you a number and then when it's ready they bring it out to you. I can't eat much because of Bariatric surgery, so we both ordered off the kids meal. Ordered a 1/4 burger with fries and my wife ordered the fish and chips. The servings were very big. I could only eat half of the the burger and a few fries and my wife couldn't finish her fish. We took the left overs in a to go box. Oh, I forgot, we ordered wings for an appetizer and brought 4 of the 7 home. Big wings and very good flavor. While our meals were only $6 a piece, the regular menu was quite a bit pricier. You can get pizza, steaks, burgers and chicken fingers. Very big menu. Loved the decor and atmosphere. On one end of the building there is a full bar and the other end is an ice cream shack. I hope it does good. Like I said the place was packed. We will definitely go back. They have several old rusty trucks outside. I'll leave pics. All in all a very nice time."}]}]}

If there's an afternoon thunderstorm in the forecast, it'll rain for a bit but it will clear up quickly, too. Offer to help dry off the tables and the servers will be very happy with you.

Hats off to the inventive and talented chef as well as our wonderful, kind and attentive server, Sara :)\n\nHighly recommended to dine here if you are passing through Jackson Hole.\n\nAll of the staff were highly engaged and we had numerous people bringing us drinks, filling our waters and clearing away empty dishes throughout the dinner. A man who we assume was the general manager stopped by several times to make sure we were happy. We devoured every dish they brought us; it was all sooo tasty and beautifully presented.\n\nAn added bonus is that the Kitchen is located a couple blocks off the main drag in a quiet neighborhood with a subdued, contemporary decor, so it feels like a peaceful oasis after the barrage of (sometimes gaudy and often overwhelming) tourists traps you encounter downtown."}]}]}

The burgers were both delicious and well prepared, but not particularly large. You can pay the $ 6 extra for the bison meat, but I couldn't make out a big plus in terms of taste. The shop was well attended and so we were seated at a large \"community\" table with a great view of the unwashed dishes. I don't think I'll go back here again.\n\n(Original)\nF\u00fcr wen es OK ist 65 Dollar f\u00fcr zwei Burger, eine Portion Onion Rings und drei Bier zu bezahlen, dem sei das Liberty Burger bestens empfohlen. Ich muss dazu sagen, dass einer der Burger vom Bison war. Aber tats\u00e4chlich war die einzige Beilage die erw\u00e4hnten Onion Rings, zu denen es aber auch keinen extra Dip oder dergleichen gab. Die Panade war trocken, br\u00f6selig und recht geschmacklos. Die Burger waren beide sehr lecker und gut zubereitet, aber nicht besonders gro\u00df. Die 6 Dollar extra f\u00fcr das Bisonfleisch kann man mal bezahlen, aber ein gro\u00dfes Plus beim Geschmack konnte ich nicht ausmachen.

Reservations highly recommend, but I did notice they were accepting walk ups with reasonable wait times considering CV19 (30-45 minutes). We were treated by a very friendly and knowledgeable waiter Siyad. He was an absolute pleasure to have. Knew the menu by heart and all sets for all plates. He accommodated changes after checking with the chef for a small up charge (veggie sub for the starch set). Started with the pork belly buns because, well, pork belly, doh! Great balance of heat and sweet with the rich braised pork belly. The bao bins could have been a little lighter and fluffier if I had any critique.\n\nNext was the entrees. The wife had the pork shank that is braised and then deep fried. Crispy on the outside and creamy tender on the inside. Sticking with the starting bite, they balanced the dish with a wonderful carrot puree, crispy carrot chips, and pickled and fresh jalepenos. Fantastic dish! I had the Korean marinated wagyu beef with bone marrow fried rice. Just read that twice and just know it was everything you hoped for. Again, very well balanced with a nice \"slaw\" on top of the rice. Beef cooked perfect medium rare. Delicious!\n\nWe also had the house spicy margaritas with Jalepeno infused tequila and a touch of blackberry puree. Not to tart and most definitely not to sweet. Great cocktail! Best meal in Jackson this far! Cheers!"}]}]}
